<h2>1. Ticket Creation</h2>

<p>
This stage involves the customer submitting a request or raising an issue, which generates a ticket in the help desk system.
</p>
<br />

<h2>2. Ticket Triage</h2>


<p>
In this stage, the ticket is reviewed by the help desk team to determine the severity of the issue(SLA's), the customer's priority level, and the appropriate next steps.
</p>
<br />


<h2>3. Ticket Assignment</h2>


<p>
After triage, the ticket is assigned to a specific support agent or team member who is responsible for resolving the issue.
</p>
<br />


<h2>4. Ticket Resolution</h2>


<p>
The assigned support agent works on the issue and resolves it according to the customer's expectations and the organization's service level agreements (SLAs).
</p>
<br />


<h2>5. Ticket Closure</h2>

<p>
Once the issue is resolved, the support agent updates the ticket with the resolution details and then closes the ticket.
</p>
<br />


<h2>6. Ticket Follow-up</h2>


<p>
In some organizations, the support team may contact the customer after the ticket closure to ensure that they are satisfied with the resolution.
<br />


<h2>7. Ticket Analysis</h2>


<p>
Finally, the help desk team may analyze the ticket data to identify trends, areas for improvement, and opportunities to streamline processes.
